Darkbot 8rc2: May 21, 2020
 	 - Bot now compiles the source files alphabetically.
         - Moved some things out of defines.h into setup.ini. Will continue
           do this and put many over those things over there.
Darkbot 8rc1: Aug 14, 2016
	- Various minor changes to some document files, spelling and grammar
	  corrections. 
Darkbot 8rc1: Aug 13, 2016
 	- Removed the annoying "Messaged: so and so" messages that tell 
 	  people with higher access about the bot messaging people. I 
 	  feel it's unnecessay and it annoys me. 
Darkbot 8rc1: Feb 25, 2016
 	- Random DUNNO responses were being sent via msg. Changed this
          so the bot responds via notice if it is messaged a question.
          This was the original behavior.
Darkbot 8rc1: Mar 04, 2005
	- Removed an unneeded line in main.c, that was used to "hide"
	  warnings on WIN32, which is a very bad idea.
	- Changed check_dbtimers() so it ignores the CVS directory,
	  which contains information for the CVS server.  This
	  fixes a situation that seems to have only presented itself
	  in FreeBSD, where it thinks the CVS directory is a 
	  timer, and sends out random garble every few seconds.
	
	- configure.ac and source/Makefile.am; very minor updates.

	- Fixed randq, which I accidentally broke when adding the
	  -I switch. This also fixes some problems that turned up
	  on FreeBSD.

	- Fixed a warning that came up in permbans.c about mixing 
	  types when compiling on OS X.  I changed %d on line 198 
	  to %ud.

	- configure now checks for clock_t.

 	- configure now automatically checks for snprintf, and 
	  uses a replacement if it's not found.

	- docs/INSTALL.txt is now INSTALL in the toplevel dir.
	  Another thing for automake to stop complaining about.

	- The original configure script is now located in the
	  scripts directory, and is called "Setup". 

	- docs/contributors.txt is now called AUTHORS in the
	  top level of the distribution.  Another thing automake
	  complains about.  I also worked on the appearance of 
	  this file, hopefully it looks a little better now.

	- README.txt in the toplevel is now called "README". 
	  Automake complains about this file also, if it's not
	  found.

	- This file is now called ChangeLog, and has been moved
	  to the toplevel distribution dir.  The reason for this 
	  is that automake complains, if it can't find this file.

	- configure now checks for the presence of windows.h, 
	  and defines WIN32, if it's found.  This removes the
	  need to do "make win".  Until I add the noconsole 
	  option again, you can run darkbot with no console by
	  doing "./darkbot &" in your cygwin shell.

	- The configure.ac file is not yet complete, and most
	  of the definitions listed in config.h are not completely
	  implemented into the code yet.  If you have problems, 
	  please let me know, and these files will become completely
	  implemented as demand is met.

	- Included premade Makefiles and configure script.

	- Added "make convertdb", which will compile the database
	  conversion utility, which encrypts the passwords in your
	  userlist.db file.

	- I added a Makefile.am in the toplevel, and in the source
	  directory.  These files are used in conjunction with 
	  GNU Automake to produce a Makefile.

        - Added Makefile.ams and configure.ac for autoconf/automake.

Darbkot 7f2: April 05, 2004

        - Fixed the google function.  Google changed some text that
          the bot was using to tell if the search was successful.

Darkbot 7f1: Mar 06th, 2004

	- Made a short dirty fix for "!randq *" crashing the bot.
	  If you do a randq query consisting entirely of * and ? 
	  characters, the bot will now just spit out a random quote.
	  This needs to be fixed better, obviously, but this will 
	  keep peoples' bots from crashing until the issue can be
	  properly addressed.

	- Changed unlink() calls to remove().  remove() is ANSI C.

	- Private message responses no longer have that "sent by" 
	  thing on them.  It was annoying, and pointless.

	- Renamed the log() function db_log() to avoid a conflict
	  with a function internal with gcc.  Apparently this only
	  affects newer versions of gcc.  

	- Removed two unused variables in convertdb.c.  I also changed
	  'unlink' to 'remove', to comply with the ANSI standard.

	- Changed forum URL to http://forum.darkbot.org, since that
          works too, looks cooler, and is shorter. :)

	- Fixed a bug that caused the bot to never respond to anything
	  after being killed.  The same problem was also fixed in a 
	  number of other situations that it was popping up. gs26() 
 	  was being called both before, and during prepare_bot(), so 
          I made the call happen only during prepare_bot().  

	- Fixed a minor flaw in convertdb.c.  It said the syntax was
	  "convertdb -convert", even if the executable wasn't named
	  convertdb.

	- Taiwanish file got dumped somehow, it's back now.

	- New setting in defines.h, AUTOHELP_GUESTS, makes the bot send
	  a message to the channel, whenever a user with the word "Guest"
	  in their nickname joins, asking them if they need help.  This 
	  can be used in help channels, to avoid Guest users just joining
          the channel, and moving on because nobody is talking.

	- I'm fairly sure I have dbcron fixed now.  I can't test it, 
	  because I don't have a system with crond, but the fix was 
          made using basic shell syntax. >> instead of >. :)

	- Please remember to include which operating system you're using
	  when reporting bugs.  This information is crucial because (all?)
	  operating systems have subtle differences that can cause any 
          number of problems in various situations.  It's impossible to 
 	  keep all of these conditions in mind when writing code, because
	  there's just so many of them.	Any other information that you can 
	  provide will, more than likely, be greatly appreciated.

	- I don't see why this is a development version anymore, so 
	  I've moved it to final. As always, any malfunctions or 
	  problems may be reported via the forum.

	- darkbot.info isn't resolving anymore, so references to this
	  site have been removed.  I left the support emails, until 
	  updated email addresses are known of.  If your email needs
	  to be updated anywhere in the code, and I didn't realize it,
	  let me know. 

	- Changed setup.ini, WHATSNEW, according to previous statement.
	
	- Updated some text in defines.h

	- Updated the title screen in main.c

	- Removed references of "make cygwin".  Just use "make win" 
	  from now on.

	- Fixed a typo in the Makefile.

	- You can use comments in the performs file now by appending
	  a '#' to the beginning of the line.  

Darkbot 7.0-RC9: Oct 19th, 2003

	- Added new channel command, "QUOTE".  All this does right
	  now is display a random line from randomstuff.ini on  
	  command.

Darkbot 7.0-RC9: Oct 5th, 2003
	- This feature was already added, but I never documented it...
	  The R~ variable (random nickname) now works in RDB topic
	  responses.  Look for randomstuff compatibility in the near
	  future, but first i have to rewrite do_random_stuff() to
	  accept a channel arguement.

	- I was reading through this WHATSNEW file, and corrected
	  a few typos that were made.

	- I removed the run_deop() code.  It didn't work very 
	  well anyway, or at all actually.  I plan on reintroducing
	  this whenever I can get some free time.

	- Fixed Ebonic language file.

	- Added Taiwanish language option.

Darkbot 7.0-RC8: June 20th, 2003
	- I screwed up the Makefile by accident, adding some
	  new features, and I hadn't finished yet when I 
	  committed. OOPS. Fixed now.

	- Updated more depricated URL strings.

	- Updated language files.

	- Minor changes on startup splash screen.

	- Support forum URL is now http://www.darkbot.org/forum

	- Updated the default servers.ini file to reflect the
	  changes.

	- You can now use Darkbot on servers which require a 
	  connection password. Check servers.ini for an 
	  example.

	- Updated some outdated text in the configure script.

	- Darkbots now default to irc.darkbot.org #darkbot.
 	  Please edit your setup.ini and servers.ini files to 
	  minimize traffic, since that is also our help channel.

Darkbot 7.0-RC7: June 2nd, 2003
	
	- Updated the INSTALL.txt file to reflect some support
	  changes.

	- Fix for possible problems with counting in datasearch
	  algorithm.  long was changed to size_t.

	- Fixed bug that prevented ACTIONs from being used on
	  RDB responses.

	- Suppressed more warnings when compiling on Solaris
	  from chan.c, in the do_math function. 

	- Removed another unused variable from url.c

	- Removed an unused variable from random.c

	- Removed the .runonce script from executing during the
	  "make" process. The funcionality this script produced
	  is depricated. Also removed this file from the distro.

	- Darkbot will now properly compile on Solaris. To make
	  this happen, you need to manually edit source/Makefile,
	  and remove a comment symbol before the word "LIBS".

	- Suppressed a warning message from main.h that happened
	  when compiling on Solaris. 

	- Makefile now works correctly on Solaris.

	- The MEM command is now limited to only users with admin
	  (level 3) access on the bot.

	- On startup, we now run_performs() BEFORE we join our home
	  channel. This fixes an issue that happened chiefly on 
	  Undernet, and allows the bot to authenticate and set 
	  umode +x, before it joins any channels.  I hope to fix 
	  this in a better way, but for now it's driving me nuts.

	- The startup screen now actually reflects what version this
	  is. Sorry, I forgot all about that startup screen, because
	  it's hard coded. hehe.

	- The Q~ variable in topic replies now works correctly. It
 	  was chopping all but the first word off, before.

	- Added MrSiMo to the list of contributors for his Arabic
	  translation.

	- The sleep command now accepts an arguement for the number
 	  of seconds you want the bot to sleep for.

	- DEFAULT_UMODE is now set immediately upon connection. 
 	  Several users said this was not being done, it was. It was
 	  just waiting >300 seconds, for whatever reason. Also, the
	  bot command PERFORMS now sets DEFAULT_UMODE in addition
  	  to running the performs file.

	- New command line option.
	  -I now specifies the location of the directory containing
          the data files (by default, dat/).

	- Multiple command line arguements are now supported. 
 	  I have no clue why this wasn't done before.

	- The .debug and .debug2 scripts were missing from the
 	  distribution. They're back now.

	- Found another place where the bot wasn't deleting old
	  userlist entries. This has been fixed.

	- Added the CHANUSERS command. All this does is return
	  a list of users on either the specified channel, or 
	  the current channel, if none is specified. I may 
	  remove this eventually, as i'm just using it for 
 	  debugging purposes right now.

	- CHANINFO command will output to whatever channel it
	  received the command from now, instead of the channel
	  it's showing data about.

	- The CHANINFO command now supports a channel name
 	  parameter. Dunno why it didn't have that before...

	- Darkbot is on CVS now at SourceForge!

	- Soapta revamped the google module.

	- The MEM command now displays the correct process. I removed
	  the -x flag from the ps command it was issuing, and it fixed
	  it. If anyone sees any reason the -x flag should be used, 
	  let me know and i'll recode the whole thing.

	- Added SETHOST alias for the VHOST command.

	- Updates to the Ebonic and French languages which define
	  Lbadtopic and Lbadtopic2 now. Other languages still need
	  this added.

	- The RDB command, which gives information about the number 
	  of RDB files, can now be used with an arguement, to tell 
	  how many lines are in a specific RDB file. It was supposed
	  to do this before, but it didn't work properly. This 
	  command is still unavailable in Windows.

	- Removed a warning concerning do_randq that happened if you 
	  compiled with RANDOM_STUFF undefined.

	- Fixed another bug that was causing the bot to never remove
	  old entries from it's internal user list. This time it wasn't
	  parsing the channel name for PARTs correctly. I also removed
	  some parsing being done on an unused variable whenever 
	  someone parted a channel.

	- Fix for RDB command... i forgot to change this when I moved
	  all of the RDB files to their own directory. OOPS! :)

Darkbot 7.0-RC6: Oct 30th, 2002

	- Added Arabic language.

	- You can now toggle the use of encrypted userlist.db passwords.
	  Check defines.h for this.

	- Fix for the bot not executing performs when it connects to 
	  a server which does not have an MOTD. Also cleaned up a small
	  amount of redundant code dealing with performs.

	- The bot will no longer crash if it encounters blank lines in
	  the info2.db during data searches (DSEARCH and SEARCH commands).


Darkbot 7.0-RC5: Sep 24th, 2002
	
	- Fixed do_randomtopic(), so it's now possible to output the first 
	  quote. it never did this before (oops).

	- Fixed the socket connection routines for windows. 

	- Fixed a rather large bug that caused the bot to never actually delete
	  users from the internal user list when necessary.
	  This also fixes another problem where the bot would put return a 
	  nickname from R~ that is not actually on the channel.
	  
	- RDB topics now support the use of tokenized responses. This includes 
	  the use of tokenized responses in the WHUT and DUNNO replies.

	- Added timers directory to the distribution, it was missing.

	- Got rid of the do_randomtopic2() function for the random dunno, and
	  random whut replies. do_randomtopic() now handles everything. This
	  cut down the size of the code a bit, and should have been how it was
	  done originally, anyway. This also means variables and also raw 
	  commands can now be used in the replies for whut, and dunno, also.

	- Added a level 3 helper command, "PERFORMS", which just executes all  
	  all commands that are in the bot's performs.ini file, at any time.

	- Fixed minor oversight that I created when adding a check for illegal	
	  characters in !nick, it now lets you use all legal characters.

	- RDB topic responses can now contain raw commands.

	- RDB files are now stored in their own directory. By default, this is 
      dat/rdb.

	- Changed get_word() function to make it a little more useful.
	  
	- Changed some error replies in the RANDQ function, and added a response 
      for the condition of randomstuff.ini being empty.
	  
	- Cleaned up the prototypes.h file, it looked really ugly. :)
	  This also reduced the total amount of code by a bit, but i'm not going
	  to bother checking just how much. :P

	- Fixed an issue in seen, that might cause the bot to improperly count
	  the number of seens in the database.

	- Fixed minor bug in add_randstuff() that caused the bot to say there was 
	  one more randomstuff in the file it's adding to than there actually was.
	  
	- Fixed a bug in do_random_stuff() that prevented the bot from outputting
	  randomstuffs, in very rare instances. This suspectedly was causing some
	  strangeness noted in Debian, and some other OSs.

	- Added a new alias for randomstuff, RS.

	- Fixed a bug in !USERLIST, that caused the bot to flood itself, and not
	  show of all of the users it was supposed to show.
      !USERLIST now works correctly, and hopefully on ALL OS.

	- Fixed a bug in !BANLIST that caused it to not output correctly on  some
	  OS.

	- Due to abuse and channel cluttering, the !VARIABLES command now messages
	  the user with the output, instead of sending it to the current channel.

    - Fixed a compilation error concerning BITCH_DEOP_REASON being undeclared.
	  What i did is remove this, and now  if BITCH_ABOUT_DEOP is turned on, it
	  just runs the list of commands in deop.ini. If BITCH_ABOUT_DEOP is turned
	  off, it does nothing when the bot is deoped. Apparently, before this 
	  version, it ALWAYS ran deop.ini, and the BITCH_ABOUT_DEOP just toggled the
	  bot saying whatever line was defined in BITCH_DEOP_REASON. That seemed kind
	  of pointless, to me, but i never noticed it before now.

Darkbot 7.0-RC4: Jun 24th, 2002
    Again, Ron did a couple necessary and urgent changes and fixes:
    - Finally, the bug in windows concerning DEL and REPLACE has
    been corrected. A function which checks readability and
    writeability was leaving the info2.db file open at startup,
    and causing all sorts of problems, since the new code structure
    was implemented.

    - NO NEED FOR TOP LINE WITH NUMBER ANYMORE on random phrase files.
    ... After yet even more problems with randomstuffs being counted 
	improperly, I've recoded the entire randomstuff routine. 
	They no longer rely on any number at the top of the file, which 
	means you can remove that number from your randomstuff.ini. 
	Optimizations made to make randomstuff more random, also.

    - Fixed a bug where Darkbot would crash when you use !nick
    with illegal characters.

    - Patched a socket issue in create_connection() that appeared
    only in windows.

   - Eliminated a warning dealing with the redefinition of size_t
     when compiling the bot in windows.

    - Eliminated all of the casting done on malloc in the program.
    Casting malloc is totally unnecessary, and can mask other
    errors.

    - Improved the fix for topics that consist entirely of "*"
    characters. It now checks for "?" also. This prevents
    segmentation faults, and topics which are entirely wild-
    cards are seriously annoying anyway. Sorry if it's in any
    inconvenience to anyone.

    - Minor cosmetic fix to the output of DBSIZE, it'll now say
    that the database is "1 byte in size", instead of "1 bytes
    in size", if it's only 1 byte. This should never happen,
    but if it does, it'll look nice. :)

    - Added #define MSG_RESPONSES to defines.h to have Darkbot
    answering or not to private queries. Check next 2 defines.
    (default is OFF)

    - Added #define ALLOW_ADD_IN_MSG to turn ON or OFF the
    possibility of ADDing database entries to Darkbot in
    private message. (default = OFF)

    - Added #define ALLOW_DEL_IN_MSG to turn ON or OFF the
    possibility of DELeting database entries from Darkbot in
    private message. (default = OFF)

    - Added RANDQ function and alias RANDQUOTE, to output a random
    line from your randomstuff.ini that contains a specified search
    string.
    RANDQ output returns a (11/23) type thing at the beginning of
    the line, which tells which quote it's showing, out of how many
    were matched in your search.
    RANDQ can be used from any channel, and in MSG. It wont output
	An obvious side effect to this, is that the ~ variable in 
	randomstuffs will evaluate to a nickname, if it's used in private 
	message (The nickname of whoever invoked it).
	To make the function toggleable a directive with the same name
    was made on defines.h (default = ON)
    Try it out, !RANDQ <stuff>

    - Added RANDQ2 command, which is the same as RANDQ, only it
    matches case sensitively.

    - Added BACKUP_RANDOMSTUFF define to backup randomstuff.ini
    file every time a random phrase is added. This was done due
    to missing contents when adding an entry on a file with a high
    ammount of phrases. Latest fixes resolves the problem but this
    define will stay to play on the safe side and/or if user likes
    to backup changed files.

    - Added hostmask code, where the bot converts hostmasks to
    *jason@*.superlink.net, or *jason@203.203.203.*.

    - After lots of complaints, the second line in the info reply
    only shows up with the stats command now.

    Shell utilities
    - Adjusted check-integrity to the non necessity anymore of top
    line with number of random entries on random phrases files.
    - configure script now forces entering  at least one server
    and at least one user level 3, on servers.ini and userlist.db
    files respectively, in case those files are empty.
    (working on checking errors on user input). 
    - added an option on 'configure' to import servers.ini and
    userlist.db from another location.
    - Added BSDs compatibility to all shell scripts.
    - Added Cygwin compatibility to AddServer, AddUser,
    check-integrity and download-databases scripts (live-update
    and dbcron not fully tested yet).

Darkbot 7.0-RC3: May 22nd, 2002

    ron@darkbot.org has worked on the following 4 issues:
    - Fixed a bug that caused crashes if the bot responds to a
    topic containing R~ in private message.

    - Fixed a bug that caused excess floods if the bot were to
    send private messages to itself.

    - Fixed a bug concerning topics that consists entirely of the
    '*' character, which caused segmentation faults. Darkbot
    will not allow you to add a topic like this now.

    - Fixed the Makefile, on my computer it kept compiling all
    of the source files seperately and then compiling them all
    together instead of linking the .o files it made.

    - Added directory logs lost in action. It is now within dat directory

    - Fixed .Stripdb and .Stripdb2 - so now points to the correct bin path

    Shell utilities: (all changed/improved - read docs/README_UTILS)
    - Added README_UTILS to docs directory with information about shell utils
    
    - Added compatibility to wget (besides lynx) on scripts that needs to
    connect to internet

    - All utility scripts now share working directory .scriptutils instead of
    having dynamic files all over scripts directory

    - download-databases now integrated on live-update (besides standalone)
    (if updated on RC3 the change will take effect next time live-update
    is executed)

    - Added a couple more features and improved others for more accuracy on
    check-integrity engine. USE IT before asking for help or going into
    paranoia if you suspect you have data errors or even if you are not
    sure eventual errors became from bad entries on data files.
    
    - Added a few features to AddUser utility
    
    - configure script now bypasses previously configured items. Just hit
    ENTER key to go to the next setup. Also it gets already configured
    parameters and use it as session defaults instead of the usual Darkbot
    defaults. The script is now linked to AddUser and AddServer with all
    features those utilities now have.
    

Darkbot 7.0-RC2: Apr 13th, 2002

    - Windows port. Not much to do at this time. Last changes
    on the core code made some commands not working properly.
    Any interested coder... the affected commands
    are DELETE, which do not delete, and REPLACE, which leaves
    in info2.db 2 entries with the same topic. I should remind
    all coders that the source must be sent together with it's
    executable/bin files. Any coder willing to participate use
    the email on top of this info or directly to me
    at LuizCB@darkbot.info . (only development matters please)

    - The following are a couple Unix scripts to help on Darkbot
    management. Most are complete, some needs small adjustments
    or more features. I've used basic sh technics on it's making,
    I should say, while learning the language on the fly.
    Please test them and send any modiffs in case you are able
    to. The idea of these shell scripts is mainly to open a door
    to C coders to implement them so it will be possible to port
    it to other platforms.

    - A more featured AddServer. Downloads and installs servers
    of the network you choose. Thanks to the folks at the 
    International Federation of IRC - http://ifirc.com
    for a job well done on your site! The merit of that will
    go to our web page on the credits area as soon as stable
    version 7 is released.

    - New crontab setup utility. Run dbcron on scripts dir and
    if crontab is active on your shell the script will do
    everything for you (10 mins interval cron job).

    - Implemented a new update utility. On scripts
    directory type ./live-update -h for help on it's
    usage. At this stage the update engine will not 
    transfer your previous directives on defines.h
    or darkbot.c to the new file, so you'll have to
    edit defines.h manually and compile Darkbot.
    The script is compatible with all Darkbot releases
    and can be launched standalone providing it's in
    scripts directory. To install it ( in case you don't have
    it with your Darkbot)  type
    lynx -source http://live-update.darkbot.info > live-update
    then chmod +x live-update
    (get-latest will no longer be available)

    - New download-databases utility. ( it will be integrated soon on
    live-update engine but can also work standalone).

    - New file-integrity utility ( still needs some ajustments and
    more features but you can use it already - works with
    download-databases utility or by itself). Type
    ./check-integrity to check info2.db. Due to unpredictable
    user entries on info2.db this utility could behave
    abnormally on some special characters. Please send me all
    info2.db file in case anything like that happens so I can
    make exclusions on the code.
    
    Changes applied by reet:
    - Fixed major bug when adding users - the password wasn't
    encrypted, thus user could never login.
    
    - Added new commands IGNORE & UNIGNORE syntax is:
    <bot> ignore <nick>
    <bot> unignore <nick>
    The ignore list is only stored in RAM, changing
    nicks will get around this ignore. This is useful
    to ignore people who query the bot too much.
    
    - Applied code optimization patches on info and check_permban,
    submited by Neil Darlow

Darkbot 7.0-RC1: Mar 2nd, 2002

    - Fixed get-latest script; besides checking for code updates
    also looks for latest news. Database files updates
    will be also done/actualized soon. It's not linked
    anywhere by now so if you want to use it type it's
    name.

    - Organized file structure; all scripts are now on scripts
    directory, documents on docs except README which is
    now on Darkbot's root dir. A new contributors file
    was created with the list of colaborators.

    - defines.h is now organized in different way and prepared
    to a "shell GUI" to be released soon.

    - Organized 'configure' in a different way. Now it starts
    with defines.h editing and then it goes to data files.

    - scripts/dbcron - a new script to execute crontab. There is
    plenty of help how to use in it. Read it. Soon the
    reconnection process will me automated. 

    - Updated makefile to reflect the new directory tree.

    - Code contributors please use this release as the base of
    your changes.

    - The next changes are code modifications also in preparation
    for release 7, mostly adapted, updated or implemented
    by reet, paul @ darkbot.info

    - Added GOOGLE feature. Simply type:
    <bot> google <search string>
    The bot will then return the first URL google
    returns.
    #define GOOGLE ON to use this feature.
    
    - ********** IMPORTANT **********************************
    - userlist.db passwords are now *ENCRYPTED*
    If you are using an older version userlist.db
    you MUST set all the passwords to 0 *** OR ***
    Cygwin/Windows users run convert.exe
    UNIX users run ./convert
    and your userlist.db will be converted
    *******************************************************
    
    - #define PERFORM_TIMER ON if you want darkbot to send its
    PERFORM.INI to the IRC server every 60 seconds, useful
    if your bot is banned from a channel, or couldn't
    log in to channel services due to a net split etc.
    It's in defines.h
    

Darkbot 7 (alpha 2.1): Dec 23rd, 2001

    - Fixed 'INFO2.DB must have at least one topic' problem. Bot
    should work normally, even if INFO2.DB is empty.
    
    - Added 'stats' support to darkbot, <botnick> stats will return
    total number of questions asked since it started
    recording. You can also do <botnick> stats <nickname> 
    to get indivdual stats from a user. dat/stats.db holds
    the data.
    
    - Added 'quiz' support to darkbot, <botnick> quiz to execute
    the quiz, it will pick a random question/answer from
    dat/quiz.db. The format of the question answer in the
    file should be <question>@<answer> 
    e.g. What is 1+1?@The answer is 2!
    quiz is still in experimental stages, check defines.h
    to enable/set it up.
    

Darkbot 7 (alpha 2): Dec 17th, 2001

    - New define - #define VOICE_USERS_ON_JOIN [on/off]
    
    - New commands: /msg bot infosize or /msg bot dbsize
    or in channel: bot infosize or bot dbsize
    returns the file size of INFO2.DB
    
    - New command: bot whisper <nick> about <topic>
    darkbot will NOTICE the user, instead of PRIVMSG
    
    - Moved source code and Makefile to source directory -
    this keeps the root tree of darkbot clean, nothing
    changes for the user, they still type make in the
    darkbot root, and the binary will be copied there.
    
    - Repaired get_rand_nick() problem - bot was still returning
    it's own nick - *should* be ok now.
    
    - Added Ron's random whut, and dunno function.
    
Darkbot 7 (alpha 2): Dec 16th, 2001

    - Removed #ifdef WIN32 references for sprintf/snprintf,
    have included the function snprintf() in general.c,
    for older compilers - #define SNPRINTF_SUPPORT should
    be switched OFF if your compiler supports snprintf()
    this is quite a change.
    
    - Due to lots of people not reading #defines.h and complaining
    about make error (clock_t), the configure script
    will display an alert about this just before defines.h
    is about to be edited.
    
    - New defines - #define CONNECT_WAIT_TIMEOUT [seconds]
    #define OP_USERS_ON_LOGIN [on/off]
    
    - New PRIVMSG commands - OP, DEOP, VOICE/V, DEVOICE/DEV/DV/,
    DVOICE, KICK/WACK/K, DELETE/REMOVE/
    FORGET/DEL, TELL, ADD/REMEMBER/SAVE,
    WHERE/WHO, ADDUSER, DIE
    Some of them aren't new, but didn't work, and are now fixed.
    Just /msg bot tell nick about topic, these commands
    usually NOTICE the user, rather than PRIVMSG.
    
    - The connection routine to the server should be better -
    instead of quitting after failing to connect, it
    will constantly cycle all the servers.
    
    - I've added CYGWIN support in the Makefile - just to hide
    those size_t warnings if you get them. If you use
    CYGWIN, just use make cygwin
    
    - Permban bug fixed.
    
    - Info/Info2 bug fixed.
    
    - NICK bug fixed - bot will keep the new nick until it quits.
    
    - There is a bug/feature where if a nick has a pipe (|) and
    requests a topic that has raw - commands, it ignores
    them - looking in to this.
