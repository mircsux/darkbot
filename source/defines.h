 * If text in que is > OUTPUT1_COUNT, delay
 * OUTPUT1_DELAY seconds. If que is > OUTPUT2_COUNT,
 * delay OUTPUT2_DELAY seconds. If number of text

 * just delete all unneeded output (ie; any text
 * and notices, but leaving in stuff like kicks
 * and modes) The defaults below are recommended,
 * as the bot isn't going to flood off. If you are
 * having the bot delete output messages and you'd
 * like to increase the que, update the 
 * OUTPUT_PURGE_COUNT to a larger number. Just keep
 * in mind if someone floods your bot with a lot of
 * VERSION requests, the bot will sit there outputting
